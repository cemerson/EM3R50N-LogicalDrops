RealisticDrops

As I've played Minecraft over the years I've often thought that what the various animals and enemies "drop" when you kill them doesn't remotely match reality. I realize this is just a game but since I prefer to play in the "survival" mode I would like things to be at least a bit more fair/realistic. So I created a mod that simply "adjusts" some things (nothing new added) to balance things out a bit. 

First of all - this mod does not address one of the biggest unrealistic mechanics of the game - that you die within 2-3 days of starting the game if you don't eat anything. Here's what this mod does do though:

* Cows no longer drop 1-3 beef. They now drop ? - ?
* Sheep no longer drop 1-3 mutton. They now drop ? - ? 
* Pigs no longer drop 1-3 porkchops. They now drop ? - ? 
* Chickens no longer drop 0-1 feathers. They drop 10-20 features.
* Zombies no longer (primarily) drop rotten flesh. They drop:
  - Their shirt
  - Their pants
  - Their head
  - Whatever else their random drop decides
* Skeletons (regular and wither) no longer drop 0-2 bones. They drop 10-20 bones and their skulls.
* Wither Skeletons also drop some coal maybe
* Zombie Pigmen now also drop 2-4 porkchops and a skull
* Witches ...


 it's totally unrealistic that your character dies within 2-3 days of starting the game if you don't eat 

 While I can't help the fact that the game will literally have you die within 2-3 days if you don't eat (totally unrealistic)

but given that the forces of nature are already against you in surival mode (i.e. you die within 2-3 days if you don't eat?!?!) I feel like it's even more unfair 


I love burgers, steaks and bacon as much as the next guy but I've never been a huge fan of how freqently one has to slaughter cows, pigs and sheep   go into my pen of cows, sheep, pigs or chickens and kill 3 or 4 of them after feeding them just to stay alive in Minecraft.
